# Yahoo SMTP Setup Instructions for OTP Email Service

## 📧 **Yahoo SMTP Configuration Complete!**

Your OTP app is now configured to use Yahoo SMTP with `bhotkabilai@yahoo.com`.

### **Current Configuration:**

- ✅ **Email Service**: Yahoo SMTP
- ✅ **SMTP Host**: smtp.mail.yahoo.com  
- ✅ **Port**: 587 (TLS)
- ✅ **Email**: bhotkabilai@yahoo.com
- ✅ **Password**: Configured

### **🚀 Ready to Test!**

1. **Open your app**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Sign up** with any email address (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. **Check your Yahoo inbox** (`bhotkabilai@yahoo.com`) for the OTP!
4. **Enter the OTP** to complete verification

### **🔍 How It Works:**

- User signs up with **any email address**
- OTP is **generated and sent to your Yahoo email** (`bhotkabilai@yahoo.com`)
- You receive the OTP in your Yahoo inbox
- Enter the OTP to verify the user's account

### **📝 Alternative: Console Logging**

If Yahoo SMTP doesn't work, OTPs will still be logged to the backend console:
```
📧 OTP for user@example.com: 123456
```

### **⚙️ Yahoo SMTP Settings:**

```
EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=bhotkabilai@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=@123yahoo!
```

### **🔒 Security Note:**

If you encounter authentication issues with Yahoo:
1. Enable "Less secure app access" in Yahoo Mail settings
2. Or generate an App Password in Yahoo Account Security
3. Use the App Password instead of your regular password
