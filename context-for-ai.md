i want to build a MERN project "Email OTP Verification System", you have to explain everything and code everything for me , always ask any question to clarify your understanding, are we ok with that?
we are going to Build a basic Sign-Up System where users register with an email and password, receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via email, and verify their email address using that OTP

Requirements

1. Frontend: React.js

2. Backend: Node.js + Express.js

3. Database: MongoDB

Other: Nodemailer (for sending OTPs), bcrypt (for password hashing), dotenv, etc.

what do you think of that? can you do that? dont generate any code until i ask for codes
